# The System Was Built to Destroy You  

The destruction of Christianity **was never just about religion alone.** It was about **erasing the foundation that made people independent from the state.**  

- **Faith gave people purpose.** Without it, they drift aimlessly, easier to manipulate.  
- **Christian morality upheld family values.** Without it, families disintegrate, and government steps in as "parent."  
- **Christian men were strong, disciplined leaders.** Without faith, men became weak, directionless, and easy to control.  
- **Christianity gave people a moral compass that transcended government authority.** Without it, the state decides what is "right and wrong."  

This isn’t just an accident. It’s **deliberate programming**—a slow, methodical replacement of **faith, family, and freedom** with **hedonism, dependence, and obedience.**

## **1. Christianity Was Removed Because It Created Uncontrollable People**  

Before 1963, **public schools taught Christian values**—not just prayer, but discipline, personal responsibility, and moral integrity. **Faith-based communities didn’t need the government to function.**  

- Families stayed together.  
- Crime was lower.  
- People relied on **churches and local communities** for help—not welfare.  

The Supreme Court’s decision to **remove Christianity from schools in 1963** (*Abington School District v. Schempp*) wasn’t just about "separation of church and state"—it was about **removing moral resistance to state control.**  

Once kids stopped learning **right from wrong** based on biblical principles, the state **replaced moral truth with moral relativism.**

## **2. How They Replaced God With the State**  

They didn’t just erase Christianity—they **replaced** it with something more sinister.  

- **God’s role as provider → replaced by government welfare.**  
- **Biblical morality → replaced by “do what feels good.”**  
- **The nuclear family → replaced by single-parent households.**  
- **Church community → replaced by social media “influencers” and state-approved activism.**  

Once faith was erased, **people became spiritually empty**—and they started filling that void with **hedonism, materialism, and political cults.**  

A **morally confused** society is **easier to control.**

## **3. Weakening Men Was Essential to This Plan**  

Strong men built civilization. **Strong men defended their families.**  

So, masculinity had to be **systematically destroyed**:  

- **Men were told leadership was “toxic.”**  
- **Fathers were removed from the home through biased divorce laws.**  
- **Male friendships were stigmatized as “problematic.”**  
- **Boys were drugged with ADHD meds to keep them passive.**  

A **weak, isolated, and feminized** man doesn’t resist. He doesn’t lead. He **obeys.**  

Now, instead of **fathers, husbands, and protectors,** we have:  

- Men addicted to **porn, gaming, and social media.**  
- Men chasing **status instead of purpose.**  
- Men afraid to **stand up for anything because they’ve been told their masculinity is the problem.**

## **4. Destroying Family Was the Final Step**  

With **faith weakened** and **men neutered,** the only thing left was **family.**  

Why? Because **a strong family is the last line of defense against state control.**  

- **Families pass down traditions and moral values.**  
- **Families raise children with purpose.**  
- **Families take care of each other without needing the government.**  

So, the system **attacked family directly:**  

- **Encourage no-fault divorce.** Make it easier than ever for families to break apart.  
- **Normalize single motherhood.** Remove fathers, making the state the new provider.  
- **Encourage women to “focus on their career” instead of having kids.** Lower birth rates = less independent, family-oriented people.  
- **Promote degeneracy as "liberation."** Hookup culture, OnlyFans, broken relationships—anything that keeps people distracted and unfulfilled.  

A population **without strong families is desperate, lost, and dependent.** Exactly what the system wants.

## **5. The Endgame: Total State Control Over Your Life**  

Let’s recap **the full playbook:**  

1. **Remove Christianity** so that morality is no longer based on universal truth, but whatever the state says.  
2. **Weaken masculinity** so men no longer defend their families or communities.  
3. **Destroy the family unit** so people turn to the government, not each other, for survival.  
4. **Promote degeneracy and hedonism** so people chase distractions instead of resisting.  
5. **Make everyone dependent** on government welfare, corporate jobs, and state-approved ideology.  

The final stage? **A society that obeys without question.**  

**When people have no faith, no strong men, and no families, they become slaves.**

## **6. How to Break Free From the System**  

The good news? **They fear people waking up to this reality.** That’s why they suppress this information.  

So what’s the solution? **Rebuild what was destroyed.**  

- **Reclaim faith.** Return to Christianity, study the Bible, and seek truth.  
- **Reject degeneracy.** Cut out porn, mindless entertainment, and anything designed to weaken you.  
- **Strengthen masculinity.** Train your body, sharpen your mind, and become the kind of man who leads.  
- **Build families and real communities.** Have children, marry strong women, and pass on values the system tried to erase.  
- **Remove dependence on the state.** Own land, develop real skills, and become self-reliant.  

**They don’t want strong, self-sufficient people who can’t be controlled.**  

That’s why **the most rebellious thing you can do today is live by the values they tried to destroy.**
