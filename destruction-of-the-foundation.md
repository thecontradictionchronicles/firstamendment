# The Destruction of Christianity: Replacing Faith With State Control  

Christianity **was never just a religion**—it was the **moral foundation that shaped Western civilization.** The United States was built on Christian values, and those values created **strong families, self-reliant communities, and a government that was supposed to be accountable to the people.**  

But the system doesn’t want strong, independent people. It wants **a weak, obedient population** that looks to the **state** instead of **God.**  

That’s why Christianity had to be **systematically dismantled**—not through open war, but through slow, calculated erosion.

## **Step 1: Remove Christianity From Schools (1963) to Destroy Moral Education**  

One of the most **deliberate attacks on Christianity** happened in 1963 when the Supreme Court **banned Bible reading and prayer from public schools** (*Abington School District v. Schempp*).  

Before this decision:  
- Schools openly **taught biblical values**—honesty, discipline, responsibility.  
- **Moral instruction** was part of education, reinforcing right and wrong.  
- **Students had a spiritual foundation** that grounded them in truth.  

After Christianity was removed:  
- Schools replaced **morality with moral relativism.** No universal truth, just "your truth" vs. "my truth."  
- **Discipline collapsed.** Crime, teenage pregnancy, and school violence skyrocketed.  
- **God was replaced with the state.** Instead of answering to a higher power, children were trained to trust government authority.  

This was **Step One**—erase God from the classroom so future generations would **never learn** biblical principles.

## **Step 2: Replace Christianity With Worship of the State**  

Faith in God was always a **threat to totalitarianism.** A society that believes in a **higher power above the government** is one that **will never fully submit** to tyranny.  

So the state **stepped in to take God’s place.**  

- **Government became the new moral authority.** The same leaders who promote war, corruption, and greed now claim to define morality through laws and policies.  
- **Science became the new scripture.** But not actual science—**state-approved science**, where questioning the narrative is considered blasphemy.  
- **Activism became the new church.** Instead of following biblical principles, people now devote their lives to political causes, treating them as religious crusades.  
- **The State became the new provider.** Instead of churches and communities helping the poor, now it’s the **government’s job**, making people dependent on handouts rather than self-reliance.  

Once faith in God was **replaced with faith in the system,** people stopped resisting government overreach.

## **Step 3: Corrupt the Church From Within**  

Since **erasing Christianity outright would cause rebellion,** the system took a different approach: **infiltrate and corrupt the church from the inside.**  

- **Water down doctrine.** Many churches stopped preaching hard truths and instead focused on feel-good messages with no substance.  
- **Push progressive ideology.** Instead of standing firm on biblical teachings, churches now embrace whatever is popular—LGBTQ ideology, feminism, and even Marxism.  
- **Create division.** Denominations were turned against each other, with false teachers promoting ideas that **contradict the Bible but align with the state’s agenda.**  
- **Replace faith with corporate-style Christianity.** Mega-churches focus more on branding, celebrity pastors, and entertainment than actual faith and community.  

Now, many churches are **spiritually dead**, offering no real resistance to the system.

## **Step 4: Promote Moral Decay to Weaken Society**  

Christianity provided **a clear moral structure** that held families, communities, and entire nations together.  

So the system **replaced biblical values with degeneracy.**  

- **Promote sexual immorality.** Biblical teachings on marriage, family, and fidelity were ridiculed, while hookup culture and porn became the norm.  
- **Destroy the family unit.** Single parenthood skyrocketed, marriage rates plummeted, and children were raised without moral guidance.  
- **Encourage nihilism.** Instead of believing life has a purpose, people are told nothing matters—leading to depression, addiction, and self-destruction.  
- **Glorify materialism.** Instead of valuing wisdom and virtue, society became obsessed with wealth, status, and instant gratification.  

A society without morality is a **society that will tolerate anything—no matter how evil.**  

---

## **Step 5: Persecute Those Who Stand Firm**  

Even after all of this, there are still **Christians who refuse to bow to the system.**  

So the government **makes an example out of them.**  

- **Censorship.** Christian voices are silenced online, labeled “hateful” or “misinformation.”  
- **Legal persecution.** Business owners are sued for following their beliefs, while churches are fined or shut down for resisting state mandates.  
- **Social exile.** Those who stand by biblical principles are mocked, ridiculed, and excluded from mainstream society.  

This isn’t an accident—it’s a **deliberate attempt to erase Christianity altogether.**

## **The Endgame: A Godless, Obedient Population**  

The destruction of Christianity **was never just about religion—it was about control.**  

- **A godless society is easier to manipulate.** Without faith, people look to the state for moral guidance.  
- **A society without Christian values loses its foundation.** Once morality becomes subjective, **evil can be justified.**  
- **A faithless generation has no higher loyalty.** People who worship the state will follow it blindly—even when it turns against them.  

The ultimate goal? **A world where the government is God.**
